How to use?
===========


You can import ``select2`` from ``js.select2`` and ``need`` it where you want
these resources to be included on a page::

  >>> from js.select2 import select2
  >>> select2.need()

If you need a specific translation use::

  >>> from js.select2 import select2_de
  >>> select2_de.need()

For the list of possible translations see
https://github.com/ivaynberg/select2/tree/3.5.1

For bootstrap css support include additionally
the required css via::

  >>> from js.select2 import select2_bootstrap_css
  >>> select2_bootstrap_css.need()
